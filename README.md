This Python script is designed to read data from an Excel (.xlsx) or CSV (.csv) file and extract group names from specified columns such as "Additional comments" or "Comments and Work notes". It searches for a keyword like "Groups" or "Group Names" within the text and identifies group names that are formatted as Groups : [code]<I>group1, group2</I>[/code]. The script handles multiple groups separated by commas, counts the occurrences of each group, and outputs the results in a readable table format.

The program is built as a reusable function, making it scalable and adaptable to different input files and keywords. Users can run the script, provide the input file path and search keyword at runtime, and receive a final output with the number of occurrences of each group. The output is written to a Word document (group_count_output.docx) for easy sharing and reference.

The script uses Python libraries such as pandas for reading Excel and CSV files, re for regular expressions to extract group names, collections.Counter to count occurrences, and python-docx to write the output to a Word file. This tool is useful for automation specialists or data analysts who need to quickly summarize group assignments or memberships from structured text data in spreadsheets.
